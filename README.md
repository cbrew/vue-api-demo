# coindesk-api-demo


This is a minimal extension of what you get from Vue CLi to draw posts
from a standard public API. The most helpful source is https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/vuejs-rest-api-axios. To make this work smoothly I incorporated the material foumd there into the
HelloWorld component. 

TODO rename component, it shouldn't be called HelloWorld any more.

## Add axios



```
yarn add axios
```
my vue-cli uses yarn as the base package manager. Caution: do not call vue add, because axios
is not a vue plugin but a regular package.


## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
